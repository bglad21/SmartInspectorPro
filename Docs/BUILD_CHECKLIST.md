# Smart Inspector Pro - Build Checklist

> This checklist provides a systematic, step-by-step guide to build Smart Inspector Pro from scratch to production launch. Each task is designed to be completed in a single request/session with clear goals, Copilot prompts, acceptance criteria, and evidence requirements. Tasks build incrementally to ensure proper architecture validation at each stage.

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: October 18, 2025
**Total Phases**: 20
**Estimated Timeline**: 85-110 days

## Standard Copilot Operating Procedures (SOPs)

Before starting any task, the Copilot must adhere to the following SOPs:

### **Standard Copilot Operating Procedure**

For every task assigned, the Copilot will adhere to the following protocol to ensure consistency, accuracy, and comprehensive project documentation.

1. **Acknowledge & Analyze:** The Copilot will first acknowledge the task ID (e.g., "Acknowledged P1-T01"). It will then review all documents listed in **Global References** and task-specific **Copilot Reference** sections.

2. **Plan & Execute:** The Copilot will state a clear, step-by-step plan before making changes. It will execute steps sequentially, announcing each step as performed.

3. **Test & Validate (Local First):** Before external integrations, perform full local validation including unit tests, integration tests, and diagnostic tools. Evidence of local validation must be provided before external integration.

4. **Verify & Document:** Work through each **Acceptance Criteria** systematically. Generate required **Evidence** for each criterion before marking complete `[x]`.

5. **Handle Blockers:** If a step fails, **STOP**. Do not retry without changing approach. Analyze error, propose debugging plan, document in `DECISION_LOG.md`.

6. **Update & Finalize:** After all criteria are met, update all documents specified in **Documents to Update** section.

- `MEMBERSHIP_TIERS_REVISED.md` - Subscription tiers
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - AI agent instructions

---

## Documents to Update

**During Build:**

- `CHANGELOG.md` - Document all changes, features, fixes
- `DECISION_LOG.md` - Record architectural decisions (create if needed)
- `BUILD_NOTES.md` - Track build progress and issues (create if needed)

**Upon Completion:**

- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Add deployment instructions
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Add common issues and solutions
- `TESTING_GUIDELINES.md` - Document testing procedures

---

## Governance & Repo Hygiene

**Git Workflow:**

- Commit after each completed task
- Use conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`
- Create feature branches for major phases
- Tag releases: `v1.0.0-alpha`, `v1.0.0-beta`, `v1.0.0`

**Code Quality:**

- Run TypeScript type checking: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Run linter: `npm run lint`
- Format code: `npm run format` (Prettier)
- Keep bundle size under 50MB

---

## Architectural Principles

1. **Offline-First**: SQLite as primary data store, sync to cloud
2. **CSV-Driven**: 6-level hierarchy (Section → System → Location → Component → Material → Condition)
3. **Premium AI**: GPT-4 Vision for photo analysis (Enterprise tier)
4. **RBAC**: Role-based access (Team Leader, Senior Inspector, Assistant)
5. **Multi-Tenant**: User/team data isolation
6. **Security**: AWS Cognito auth, JWT tokens, S3 encryption

---
