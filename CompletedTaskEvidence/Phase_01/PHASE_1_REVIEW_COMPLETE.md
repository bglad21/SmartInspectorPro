## VS Code Configuration Review

### Installed Extensions (9 total)

✅ **Required Extensions** (from IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md):

1. ✅ ESLint (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`)
2. ✅ Prettier (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`)
3. ✅ React Native Tools (`msjsdiag.vscode-react-native`)
4. ✅ GitLens (`eamodio.gitlens`)
5. ✅ Path Intellisense (`christian-kohler.path-intellisense`)

✅ **Additional Productivity Extensions**: 6. ✅ ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets (`dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets`) 7. ✅ npm Intellisense (`christian-kohler.npm-intellisense`) 8. ✅ React Native Snippet (`jundat95.react-native-snippet`) 9. ✅ Auto Close Tag (`formulahendry.auto-close-tag`)

### Workspace Configuration

✅ **Settings File**: `.vscode/settings.json` (190 lines)

- Format on save enabled
- ESLint auto-fix enabled
- TypeScript path preferences configured
- React Native debugger settings
- File association rules
- Search exclusions optimized

✅ **Launch Configurations**: `.vscode/launch.json` (7 configurations)

- Debug Android
- Debug iOS
- Attach to packager
- Run Android on device
- Run iOS on device
- Debug in Exponent
- Attach to running Metro

✅ **Extension Recommendations**: `.vscode/extensions.json`

- All 9 extensions listed as recommendations
- Team members will be prompted to install

## Deferred Items (Intentional)

The following items from IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md were **intentionally deferred** to later phases:

### 1.5 Backend Development Tools (Deferred to Phase 11+)

- ⏳ PostgreSQL 16 (not needed until backend development)
- ⏳ Redis (not needed until backend development)
- ⏳ AWS CLI (AWS Amplify v6 SDK used instead - Phase 3)
- ⏳ AWS Amplify CLI (AWS Amplify v6 SDK used instead - Phase 3)

**Justification**: These tools are not required for mobile app development in Phases 1-10. The project uses AWS Amplify v6 SDK (configured in Phase 3) instead of AWS CLI/Amplify CLI. Backend development tools will be installed when backend development begins (Phase 11+).

### 1.6 Optional Development Tools

- ⏳ React Native Debugger (can be installed as needed)
- ⏳ Flipper (can be installed as needed)
- ⏳ Postman (not needed until backend API development)
- ⏳ TablePlus (not needed until database development)

**Justification**: These are optional/convenience tools that can be installed on-demand. The core debugging capabilities are available through Xcode, Android Studio, and VS Code.
